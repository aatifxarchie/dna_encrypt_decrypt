# dna_encrypt_decrypt
This repository hosts one of the most amazing projects I have created. There is a great possibility of data storage through DNA encryption and decryption today and continuous efforts towards this domain have been going on across the world. I have simulated storing textual data in the form of sequence of nitogenous bases -'A','G','C','T'. First, it converts the text into binary(0s and 1s) and then generates a sequence of nitrogeneous bases for the data entered by the user.
